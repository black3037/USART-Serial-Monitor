A multi-platform (OSX,LINUX coming soon) graphical interface debugging USART serial connections.
The UI can send and recieve messages from USART serial (possibly others protocalls as well, has not been tested yet).
This UI assumes strings sent from the command line are new line \n deliminted. This can easily be changed in the code.
